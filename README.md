# Tennis Club Project
A tennis club manager is in need for a system to manage his/her tennis club. By using the system, the manager can add information about the courts available, their location and type (e.g. crass, clay, ...). Each court has an associated schedule that comprises three different types of events: i) bookings by the tennis users of the club, ii) tennis lessons given by some tennis teacher, iii) occasionally some tournaments. The manager can CRUD events of type ii) and iii), while for type i) users of the club need to login to reserve a place in the schedule. Each user can only reserve maximum 2 hours per day, and at the moment of booking they need to define the names of other participants to the reserved time (only other users of the club are allowed). The manager can search through the list of all users to see their profile information. He can also get for each user the statistics about the total number of hours reserved per week, per month, and yearly.
